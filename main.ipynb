So we should not\\nfollow western culture(even banned in Christianity).  \\nOur creator, the Almighty has made our metabolism in such a way that we can\\nonly get attracted or do marrige from our opposite sex person. So a big\\nmisconception is cleared here that homosexuality comes from our ancestor's\\ngenes. Earlier there was a hypothesis by a scientist who said that it may be\\ngenetic but later on it was discovered that the scientist himself was a\\ngay(psychologically not genetically). When people break the laws of\\nnature(like having sex with multiple persons of their opposite sex) their mind\\nlater gets diverted to people of their own gender(like in western countries\\nearlier, there were so called mistresses 10 or 15 for a single man) who\\nfulfill the needs of wives for him alone. So, its our fault that we had\\nmultiple relationships which made us psychologically so ill that we started\\ngetting intrest in our own gender people also. God never made us like this nor\\nhe will. We are breaking the rules of nature. It is also scientically proven\\nthat having a single partner and enjoying a sex life with him/her throughout\\nyour life rather than being a playboy or playgirl(sorry for the words) make us\\na better human being in terms of both gender and obeying God's commandments.\\nSo homosexuality is a sin in almost every religion and we should not legal it\\nin India. We should teach our future generations to have respect for their\\nopposite gender person(especially to boys) so that they do not develop a\\nmindset that girls are made for having fun(this will harm that boy\\npsychologically later), he may start finding intrest in his male friends just\\nto complete his fantasies. Same apply for girls. We should get bounded to the\\nrules made by nature and find a single life partner for us whom we can persue\\nour sexual and spiritual life.  \\nAt last I would complete my stand by saying that God says us to follow the\\nTruth rather than to follow people who speak that homosexuality should be\\nlegal in India on behalf of their democracy.

You\\nactually said a lot of things wrong:  \\n1\\\\. He understands how wrong his attitude is  \\n2\\\\. Looses his license even though he could have lied and won the case; this\\nshows how the character matures and starts to remorse his attitude  \\n3\\\\. He is a kind of person who runs away from a complex situation but at the\\nend he never wanted to bring that as an excuse (had it not been his friend,\\ngirl would have never known). He did wrong and he realised.  \\n4\\\\. Totally wrong when you say he is abusing his parents. The ending parts\\nshows how his relation with father changed.  \\n5\\\\. Totally wrong when you say he used to stalk that girl even after breakup.\\nHe never does that even though he is unable to move on  \\n6\\\\. If u see the movie you will understand how he started hating himself. A\\nman who is narcissistic by nature when he starts to be ashamed of his\\npersonality and attitude, its a very big positive change.  \\n7\\\\. Okay i agree he ends up getting the girl in a very unrealistic way, but\\nthe scene where he is ready to accept the baby and give him a father without\\nanything spoken shows the purity in his love (i agree the ripening of the\\nrelationship was very bollywood typical though)  \\n8\\\\. yes agreed that he was self harming but nowhere did he let the girl know\\nabout it and hence force her to take any decisions based on that. The person\\nis fake masculine i agree but not manipulative so you cant call it abusive\\nrelationship.  \\n9\\\\. This guy cares so much about the girl that he rubs her shoulder after\\nremoving her heavy bag.  \\n10\\\\. The girl had equal domination rights in him as well. She slaps him when\\nhe was out of control angry in a public place and he starts to apologise. I am\\nsorry I do see a trait of matured and very mentally intimate relationship\\nhere.  \\n11\\\\. I agree his background was typical bollywood but again as you mentioned\\nif he was not so pampered he would not have done all the blunders (a humble\\nbackground would end up seeing him in jail and maybe a underworld don\\nbiography can be written after that), so to give the film all the colours he\\nhad to belong to a family of means. How about 50 shades of grey as an example\\n!  \\n12\\\\. Apparently he never reads(according to you) but how about the fact that\\nhe took her and taught her a lot during a song and never tried to take\\nadvantage of her (she made the first move which shows her agreement). Its also\\nshown even though he tries to be masculine he never really could face the girl\\nfor long, he was not comfident till the girl agreed.  \\n13\\\\. You need to agree that girl enjoyed the character and hence he could be\\nwhat is portrayed. And hence like kabir (which i do consider a realistic\\nflawed person), preeti is also a very real character, silent but manipulative.  \\n14\\\\. Regarding that sex scene. Thats a typical example of rape. Many rapist\\nactually raped when they were mentally unstabled adding physical needs\\n(hormones) on top of that. But he says he is sorry and leaves (he dis wrong\\nbut he realises, isnt that good? Isnt that what a normal person should do?)  \\n15\\\\. He is tharki? Yes he is ... its his sadness mixed with hormones, a very\\ntypical situation of being desparate. But that same person never wanted to go\\ninto a fake relationship, isnt that honesty and maturity? He never wanted to\\nhurt anyones feelings like his were hurt. All he wants is sex! Isnt that what\\nhookup culture is in modern Metros? People hookup even without any mental\\ndesparation, just for fun. Why is that not a very real situation then?  \\n  \\nPlease feel free to couter attack me with a debate. But till then your reviews\\nare as flawed and biased as the charecter of kabir.  \\nPs. I am a big fan of ur work and not a narcissist sympathizer. Dont worry man\\ntodays youth gets enough dose of dumb sexual contents. They are gullable. And\\nsex sells, thats truth, hence is sold by bollywood.

It did exactly what it set out to do. With Arjun Reddy and\\nnow Kabir Singh, the director Sandeep Vanga is only exhibiting a different\\nkind of genre by narrating the story from the perspective of a protagonist\\nwho's grossly flawed. For once we are shown the film through the prism of grey\\nrather than the extremes of black or white. Because the story unfolds from his\\nperspective, Kabir thinks he's the right kind of man, always in the right,\\nwronged by circumstances and justifies his alcohol and substance abuse on the\\nsame basis, which is typical of any addict. Throughout the duration of the\\nmovie, he doesn't realize the fact that the fault lies solely with him. That\\nit's his nature that's rotten, not his destiny.  \\n  \\n  \\nThroughout the film, we are shown his downward spiral into insanity, almost\\nfeeling a sense of suffocating hopelessness as though we too are infected by\\nhis self-inflicted agony. Vijay/Shahid both did a great job in conveying this\\ntorment in their respective renditions of the character. This misery continues\\ntill the very end, up to the point where we as an audience have given up any\\nkind of hope of redemption for the protagonist, when he does a 360 degree turn\\nby finally acknowledging his problem and sets out to seek salvation. I didn't\\nfind anything remotely wrong about this movie. The film doesn't in any way\\nglorify the character. On the contrary it makes you feel disgusted and\\nrepulsed by him to the extent that you'd never even think of following his\\nlifestyle. You'd completely abhor it. Personally, speaking from experience, as\\na person who's never had alcohol or consumed drugs or been a domineering\\nmisogynist for that matter, the film rather than giving me a wrong message\\ninstead made me all the more determined not to stray on to such a path. You\\nliterally end up begging the character to mend his ways. The supporting\\ncharacters in the movie like Kabir's brother and his friends are all the while\\ntrying to draw him out of his ruination but to no avail. This film is in fact\\na very revolutionary step in Indian cinema, depicting a story about a flawed\\nman, languishing in a greyish-dark space rather than lily-white or pitch-\\nblack. Usually our films don't go into that area. The film actually delivers a\\npositive message that you can start redeeming yourself even when you touch the\\nrock bottom of hell as long as you possess the will to do so. When Kabir is at\\nhis lowest point after being debarred from his profession and having suffered\\na personal tragedy, he is at the rock bottom of his pit and he has to make the\\nchoice whether he wants to remain confined to the darkness of the pit for\\neternity in a limbo or start climbing out of it. He does the latter and thus\\nthe film after subjecting us to a lot of darkness and discomfiture for most of\\nits runtime leaves us with the teensiest glimmer of hope. Just like life.  \\n  \\nFor all those who were unsettled and disturbed by the movie, as I said\\nearlier, it was supposed to make you feel so. The superlative acting and\\ntechnical expertise made the movie a worthwhile experience.  \\n  \\n  \\nI wish all these ultra-feminists and so-called liberals watch this movie with\\nan open mind and learn to accept a posture distinct from their own. Especially\\nsince this breed cries hoarse when accusing the right wing of trying to\\ndistort history and current narratives to impose their points of view, when\\nthey are themselves intolerant to those of others. To deny that people like\\nArjun Reddy/Kabir Singh exist, would be denying the harsh reality of society.\\nThese are the same people who whoop and clap when Swara Bhaskar masturbates\\nand abuses her husband on screen.\", 'No view but 207 likes😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣🤣', \"Why doesn't Raw or IB bump off such people.\", '@mohammed anna brother the personality that he possessed in the clg topper of\\nd university clg ,clg football team captain nd anger no junior dare to stand\\nagainst him nd the scene totally supports his character in d movie', 'Wow!!! my thought match with you...you are doing well...', 'Even a degraded PROSTITUDE has a better charecter then this scunk Arundhadi\\nRoy.
